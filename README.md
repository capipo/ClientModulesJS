# ClientModulesJS

Javascript library to load modules on the client side,
node.js like, using promises for download asynchronously.

My English is not very good,
at the moment the README file is only in Spanish
and you can see it [here](https://github.com/capipo/ClientModulesJS/blob/master/README.es.md)
sorry for the inconvenience.
